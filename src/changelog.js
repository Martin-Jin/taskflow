/**
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG
 * ============================================================================
 * User-facing "what's new" history, shown via ChangelogModal (Settings →
 * Versions, and auto-popped the first time a signed-in-or-not visitor loads
 * a build newer than the one they last saw — see App.jsx's
 * `lastSeenChangelogVersion`).
 *
 * Entries are newest-first. `CURRENT_VERSION` is always the first entry's
 * version — bump it (and add a new entry above) with every push that ships
 * a user-visible change. Written in plain English for end users, not a raw
 * commit log — group related commits into one entry if they shipped together
 * (e.g. same day) and skip anything with no user-visible effect.

    version: '1.9.0',
    date: '2026-07-29',
    title: 'Version history & fewer Google sign-in prompts',
    changes: [
      'Added this "What\'s New" panel — see everything that changed in each update, searchable, from Settings → Versions.',
      "Google Calendar no longer prompts you to sign in on every single app open — your connection now stays active for its full session instead of re-authenticating on every load.",
    ],

  {
    version: '1.8.0',
    date: '2026-07-29',
    title: 'Fixed editing of recurring Google Calendar events',
    changes: [
      'Recurring events synced from Google Calendar can now be edited, dragged, resized, and deleted — previously this silently failed for anything that repeats.',
      'Editing a recurring event now asks whether the change applies to "this event", "this and following", or "all events", matching Google Calendar\'s own behavior, and single-occurrence edits push back to Google correctly.',
      'Tasks can now optionally be pinned to a fixed time of day instead of letting the auto-scheduler pick a slot.',
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.7.0',
    date: '2026-07-29',
    title: 'Dashboard widget customization',
    changes: [
      'Dashboard sections you don\'t use (e.g. Pinned Links) can now be hidden via a gear-icon popover, with the remaining widgets expanding to fill the freed space.',
      'This preference is saved per device, same as your calendar zoom and task view settings.',
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.6.0',
    date: '2026-07-29',
    title: 'Paste screenshots directly into comments',
    changes: [
      'You can now paste a screenshot (e.g. Win+Shift+S) straight into a task\'s comment box with Ctrl+V, instead of saving it to disk first and picking the file.',
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.5.0',
    date: '2026-07-29',
    title: 'Sub-tasks, comments with attachments, and sync fixes',
    changes: [
      'Sub-tasks are now full tasks in their own right — they show up alongside regular tasks and support everything a normal task does.',
      'Added a Completed tasks tab, with the ability to restore a completed task and an automatic 30-day cleanup of old completions.',
      'Tasks now support a comment thread with file attachments (Firebase-backed), similar to Todoist.',
      'Fixed a sync bug where a stale change from one device could overwrite newer data already saved to the cloud from another device.',
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.4.0',
    date: '2026-07-28',
    title: 'Task list, dashboard, and task detail refinements',
    changes: [
      'Added a dedicated Labels/tags page.',
      'The dashboard now distinguishes overdue tasks from tasks merely scheduled for today.',
      'Fixed save/cancel behavior and sizing glitches in the task detail editor.',
      'Fixed scrolling issues in Board view.',

    version: '1.3.0',
    date: '2026-07-27',
    title: 'Calendar rebuild, backups, and live cross-device sync',
    changes: [
      'Rebuilt calendar event editing to match Google Calendar\'s own look and feel.',
      'Added backup/restore — both as a local file export/import and as automatic snapshots saved to the cloud.',
      'Signed-in changes now sync live across every device you use TaskFlow on, instead of only updating on next load.',
    ],
  },
  {
    version: '1.2.0',
    date: '2026-07-26',
    title: 'Dashboard, smarter task parsing, and multi-project support',
    changes: [
      'Added the Dashboard tab.',
      'Typing a task title now supports Todoist-style project/section mentions with live autocomplete.',
      'Todoist import is now a one-time pull rather than an ongoing sync.',
      'Added support for multiple projects, with sidebar shortcuts and filters.',
      'Polished Board view and mobile layout.',
    ],

    version: '1.0.0',
